There are 2 TCP connection. The first one is control connection and the second one is for data. Each connection is encrypted by TLS 1.2.
Control connection uses UTF-8. Each transmision is terminated by "<EOF>" sequence. Client is master and server slave.
Data connection is purely binary.

Firsts, client connects to server at the port 8471. After TLS handshake, the server sends to client port for data connection. 
After than client connects to selected port and do TLS handshake on data port.
